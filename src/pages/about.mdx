# About us

## History

In the late 1980's Kamaljit Rai immigrated to Surrey from Boparai Khurd, a small village in Punjab, India. Here, he started his career in plumbing by challenging his exam for the plumbing license. In the early 90's Kamaljit's brother; Darshan (Laddi) also immigrated to Surrey and joined him in the business.

During his years in the trade, Kamaljit would wake up his sons; Jason and Tarn in the early mornings at every opportunity _(weekends, especially school holidays)_ and bring them to work with him.

Forced to wake up at unimaginable hours (or so it seemed) as children, Jason, the older son, would grow to love the trade and eventually follow in dad’s footsteps with Tarn following close behind.

Since the birth of Rai Plumbing Ltd in 1996, we have built strong, loyal relationships with our customers. Rai Plumbing brings trust, friendship, and fairness to customers and their homes.

Rai Plumbing Ltd. is dedicated to delivering the highest level of quality and customer service.
